# Imageanalysis

n a deep learning classifier for any binary image classification task of your choice. The 
deep-learning classifier should consist of a set of convolutional and fully connected layers 
followed by the final output layer for image classification. Extract features from the samples in 
the validation set (using one of the fully connected layers of your model) and train a SVM (linear 
or non-linear) using these samples for the same classification task. Test this SVM on the test set 
(extract the features from the test set using the same fully connected layer). Use appropriate metrics 
to evaluate the SVM model on the test set.
